            <p>
                Monkey D. Luffy (/ˈluːfi/ LOO-fee) (Japanese: モンキー・D・ルフィ) , also known as "Straw Hat " Luffy, is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the One Piece manga series, created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut in One Piece Chapter #1 as a young
                boy who acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating the supernatural Gum-Gum Fruit, one of the Devil Fruits. Luffy dreamt of being a pirate since childhood from the influence of "Red-Haired " Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy
                sets sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as "King of the Pirates ". Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, recruits crew members Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp,
                Sanji, Tony Tony Chopper, Nico Robin, Franky, Brook, and Jimbei. He fights antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious and even aggressive when he fights.
                Luffy uses his elasticity to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks. In his signature attack, Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance. Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story, as reflected
                in his "bounty ", which is used to measure the threat he poses to the World Government.

                Zoro is the first crewmate to join Monkey D. Luffy's crew after he is saved (by Luffy and Koby) from being executed at the Marine Base by Captain Morgan. He is the crew's combatant,[1] and one of the two swordsmen of the Straw Hat Pirates,
                the other being Brook. As a native to the East Blue, he came from the village known as Shimotsuki, where he trained in a dojo and learned the one and two-sword styles (ittōryū and nitōryū), also he is proficient in both Armament Haki and
                Observation Haki, as well as being one of the few known characters who possess Conquerors Haki. Zoro is uniquely known as an expert of Santōryū (Three Sword Style), where he wields a third sword with his mouth in combat. Throughout the
                series, his primary sword is Wado Ichimonji, one of the World's 21 great swords that he inherited from a childhood friend Kuina, and is frequently the sword that he wields in his mouth, while the other two swords frequently change over
                time and get better. He also has a habit of frequently going into the wrong locations which is a running gag throughout the whole series.

            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            <p>
                Nico Robin (ニコ・ロビン, Niko Robin) is a fictional character and one of the main female protagonists appearing in the manga series One Piece, created by manga artist Eiichiro Oda. The character made her first appearance in the 114th chapter of the series,
                which was first published in Japan in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on November 22, 1999. In the series, Robin is introduced as an antagonist, but eventually becomes the seventh member of the Straw Hat Pirates crew, captained
                by Monkey D. Luffy. Acting as the group's archaeologist and historian, Robin is a Devil Fruit user who possess the power of the Flower-Flower Fruit, allowing her to sprout replicas of her limbs, and later her entire body, from any surface.
                As the only survivor of the island of Ohara, Robin is the only known living person in the world of One Piece with the ability to read the ancient stones called Poneglyphs, something considered threatening by the World Government, which
                forbids the practice. Robin has become extremely popular and somewhat of a breakout character in anime and manga fandom. She has also appeared in several adaptations based on the manga, including the anime television series in which she
                is voiced by Yuriko Yamaguchi in the original Japanese language, as well as by Veronica Taylor and Stephanie Young in the English versions. She has also become a popular subject of cosplay, causing a trend in Japan where women attempted
                to replicate her iconic costume.
